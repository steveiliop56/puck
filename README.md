## Puck üèí

Puck (Package Update Checking Kit _yes I know it sucks_) is a simple tool that connects to your servers and checks for
apt package updates.

> Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è: Puck is in early stages of development it still has a lot of missing features I want to add. I hope I can have a stable release soon.

### Features üò≤

Well about that...

- Tiny CLI (only 10mb)
- Beautiful CLI
- Really fast\*

> Puck itself is really fast since it's written in GO but the actual speed depends on the server

### Todo üìÉ

- [x] Redesign the CLI UI
- [ ] Docker Image
- [ ] Web UI
- [ ] Notifications (via ntfy/discord)
- [x] Ability not to use sudo (for systems running with root)
- [ ] Update systems?
- [x] Support for other package managers (currently only supporting apt)

### Running üèÉ

Puck is built for multiple architectures and systems and you can simply download it and run it from the release page, thats it!

### Building üõ†Ô∏è

You can build `puck` very easily by installing go and git on your pc and then simply running:

```bash
go build .
```

The build is really fast and when it finished you should have a binary called `puck` in your current directory.

### Usage

Puck is really simple to use, it works using a simple yaml configuration file. Here is an example:

```yaml
servers:
  - name: myserver
    hostname: 192.168.1.5
    username: someone
    password: hello!

  - name: server2
    hostname: server2.local
    username: me
    password: reallysecurepassword
    privateKey: /some/path/id_rsa
    noSudo: true
```

Here is the reference table for the available options:

| Name         | Description                                       | Type      | Required |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| `name`       | Name of the server you can put whatever you want. | `string`  | yes      |
| `hostname`   | IP or hostname of the server.                     | `string`  | yes      |
| `username`   | Username for ssh.                                 | `string`  | yes      |
| `password`   | Password used for ssh and for sudo.               | `string`  | yes      |
| `privateKey` | Private key path to use for ssh.                  | `string`  | yes      |
| `noSudo`     | Don't use sudo to run the commands.               | `boolean` | no       |

After you make your configuration file you can use puck like so:

```bash
./puck check
```

Puck be default will look for `puck.yml` but if you wish to use a different file name you can use the `-c` or `--config` flag to specify a custom path.

### Contributing ‚ù§Ô∏è
